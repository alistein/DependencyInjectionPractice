#### Dependency Injection
##### DI is mainly for injecting the concrete implementation into a class that is using abstraction (i.e. ICustomerCommunication interface). The main idea of DI is to reduce the coupling between classes and move the binding of abstraction and concrete implementation out of the dependent class. We can implement DI in 3 ways:

- Constructor Injection
- Method Injection
- Property Injection
