### Dependency Inversion Principle
##### DIP is a software design that guides us to write loosely classes. According to the definition of DIP on the wiki:

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

- Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)
##### Inversion of Control (IoC) is the technique that helps us to make higher-level modules to depend on abstractions rather than the concrete implementation of lower-level modules. In other words, it helps to implement the (Dependency Inversion Principle â€” DIP)
